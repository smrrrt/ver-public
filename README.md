Ver Browser
===========

Ver (short for "Version") is a developer-first, privacy-always web browser built on Chromium.

The goal of Ver is simple:
give developers full control, reduce tracking to the absolute minimum, and provide a fast, clean environment for building, testing, and browsing the modern web.


Philosophy
----------

Ver is built around three core ideas:

1. Developer First  
   Everything in Ver is designed to make development, debugging, and experimentation easier.

2. Privacy Always  
   Privacy is not a feature, it is the default.  
   No telemetry, no profiling, no background data collection.

3. Transparent by Design  
   You should always know what the browser is doing and why.


Features
--------

- Chromium engine for maximum compatibility
- Minimal UI focused on productivity
- Strong privacy defaults
- No telemetry or tracking
- Developer-friendly workflows
- Fast startup and low overhead
- Designed to be extensible and modifiable


Non-Goals
---------

Ver is not:
- an adtech platform
- a data collection product
- a social browser
- a crypto browser
- an AI surveillance device

Ver exists to browse and build the web — nothing more.


Project Status
--------------

Ver is currently in active development.
Expect breaking changes and rapid iteration.


Why Ver?
--------

Modern browsers are optimized for corporations, advertisers, and analytics platforms.

Ver is optimized for you.
